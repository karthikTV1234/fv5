What is Hot Reload?
Hot Reload is a feature in Flutter that allows you to quickly inject code changes into a running app without restarting the entire application.
When to use: When you make UI changes, fix small logic issues, or add new widgets.

To perform a Hot Reload:
  1. In Visual Studio Code: Press r in the terminal or click the Hot Reload button in the debug toolbar.
  2. In Android Studio: Click the Hot Reload button (a lightning bolt icon).

Hot Restart:
  1. What it does: Restarts the app and rebuilds everything from scratch.
  2. When to use: When you make changes to global variables, app initialization, main() function, or when the app behaves oddly after multiple hot reloads.

To perform a Hot Restart:
  1. In Visual Studio Code: Press Shift + R in the terminal or click the Hot Restart button.
  2. In Android Studio: Click the Hot Restart button (a circular arrow icon).
