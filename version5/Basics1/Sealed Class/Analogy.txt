Imagine a TV remote.
A TV remote has only a few fixed actions:

 1. Turn On
 2. Turn Off
 3. Increase Volume
 4. Decrease Volume

You don’t want anyone to add random actions like Make Coffee or Fly to Mars.
You only want the four valid actions.

✅ Sealed classes help you do that!

With a sealed class, you can say:
  1. "Only these actions are allowed!"
  2. If someone tries to add a new action, the code will show an error.


✅ Why use it?
 1. No invalid actions. You can’t add "Make Coffee" as an action.
 2. All actions are handled. If you forget to handle any action, the code gives a warning.
 3. Code is safer and easier to understand.
