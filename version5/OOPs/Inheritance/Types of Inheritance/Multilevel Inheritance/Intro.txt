What is Multilevel Inheritance?
1. In Multilevel Inheritance, classes are organized in a chain where:
   1. Child inherits from Parent.
   2. Grandchild inherits from Child.
   3. The last child in the chain gets all the methods from the parent and grandparent! ðŸš¦


ðŸš¦ Why use Multilevel Inheritance?
1. Code Reusability: No need to rewrite whatâ€™s already inherited.
2. Hierarchy: Organize classes from general to specific.
3. Extensibility: Add new features at each level.
