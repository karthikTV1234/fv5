Defining Mixins:
In Dart, you define a mixin using the mixin keyword.

mixin MixinExample {
  // Add methods and properties here
}


Using Mixins in a Class:
  Once youâ€™ve defined a mixin, you can apply it to any class using the with keyword.

Syntax:
class ClassName with MixinName {
  // Class body
}

Using Multiple Mixins:
  You can apply multiple mixins by separating them with commas.
  
  Order Matters:
     If multiple mixins have methods with the same name, the last applied mixin wins


Rules for Mixins in Dart
  1. No Constructors: Mixins cannot define constructors.
  2. Multiple Mixins: You can mix in multiple mixins, separated by commas.
  3. Order Matters: Later mixins override earlier ones if there are conflicts.
