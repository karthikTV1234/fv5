1. Inheritance means creating a new class from an existing class.
   1. The existing class is called the Parent (or Base or Super) class.
   2. The new class is called the Child (or Derived or Sub) class.

2. The child class inherits the properties (variables) and behaviors (methods) of the parent class.
3. This helps us reuse code and avoid writing the same logic again.



Syntax:
Java, Dart
class Parent {
    // Parent properties and methods
}

class Child extends Parent {
    // Child properties and methods
}


kotlin:
open class Parent {
    // Parent properties and methods
}

class Child : Parent() {
    // Child properties and methods
}


python:
class Parent:
    # Parent properties and methods
    pass

class Child(Parent):
    # Child properties and methods
    pass
