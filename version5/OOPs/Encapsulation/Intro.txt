Imagine a TV remote:
  1. The internal circuit is hidden.
  2. You only get buttons (like power, volume, and channel) to interact with it.
  3. This prevents you from accidentally messing with the circuit.

In programming, encapsulation works the same way:
  1. Private fields/variables: Keep the data hidden.
  2. Public methods: Control access to the data.
