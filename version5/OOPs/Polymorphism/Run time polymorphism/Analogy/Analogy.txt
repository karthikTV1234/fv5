Imagine a person who acts differently in different places:
1. At school, the person behaves like a student.
2. At home, the person behaves like a son.
3. At a shopping mall, the person behaves like a customer.


The person is like a parent class reference (common identity).
The roles (student, son, customer) are like child classes that override the common behavior.
The behavior is determined at runtime depending on the situation (context).
