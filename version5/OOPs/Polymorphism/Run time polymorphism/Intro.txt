Runtime Polymorphism (Dynamic Polymorphism)/Method Overriding:
1. In method overriding, a child class provides its own implementation of a method defined in the parent class. 
2. The method that gets called is determined at runtime.






In programming, this is like having a base class called Person and different subclasses for each role — Student, Son, and Customer.
