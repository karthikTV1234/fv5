Compile-Time Polymorphism (Static Polymorphism)/Method Overloading/Operator Overloading:
1. This type of polymorphism is resolved at compile time.
2. In method overloading, multiple methods have the same name but different parameters. 
3. The compiler decides which method to call based on the arguments.


âœ… Why is this Compile-time Polymorphism?
The method name is always unlock(), but the parameters are different.
The correct method is determined at compile time based on the arguments you pass.
This is called Method Overloading.
